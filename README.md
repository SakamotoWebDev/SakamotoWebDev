- Hi, I’m @SakamotoWebDev
- I’m interested in Websites, Design, and Independent Web Presence.
- I enjoy learning and testing new concepts and products.
- I’m looking to collaborate on .HTML, .CSS, .JS, .PY among others.
- Fun fact: Occasionally, an extra second, called a “leap second,” is added to our clocks to
  keep them in sync with Earth’s rotation, which can slow down due to various factors.
