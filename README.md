 Hello, I’m @SakamotoWebDev

 *a user of energized Rocks etched in Hieroglyphs following Instructions.*

- Hooked on UI/UX Engineering and Design.
- Inspired by a belief in independent web presence.
- I enjoy solutions that are persistent, immutable, and original.
- I enjoy learning new concepts and implementing new methodologies.
  
*I believe in the Power of open source.*
*I support the Right to secure proprietary information.*

*Our challenge, as the Information Technology community, is to find a Reasonable, Ethical, and Effective balance between both.*
    
I am fascinated by the impact of Moore's Law and how it will affect Humanity.
We are the universe experiencing itself, and fortunate, are We, to be aware of it.

- Aspiring polyglot, open to collaboration in and/or instruction on:
  
  *'.py', '.js (.jsx)', '.java', '.cpp', '.cs', '.ts', '.sql', '.go', '.swift', '.rs'*
