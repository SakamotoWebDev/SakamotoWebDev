- Hi, I’m @SakamotoWebDev
  
- Making Smart Rocks etched in hieroglyphs do Neat Tricks

- I am interested in Websites, UI/UX Design and Engineering, and Independent Web Presence.
- I believe in the power of open source,
- I also believe in the security of proprietary information;
  
    *The challenging aspect is how We, the Information Technology community, find a reasonable balance between the two.

- I enjoy learning about new concepts, tools, and products.
- Aspiring polyglot, open to collaboration and/or instruction on:
  
      '.py', '.js (.jsx)', '.java', '.cpp', '.cs', '.ts', '.sql', '.go', '.swift', '.rs'
  
- I am intrigued by the impact of Moore's Law and how it will affect Humanity. 
- The universe is discovering itself and we are the translators.
