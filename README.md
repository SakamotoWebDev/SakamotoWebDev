- Hi, I’m @SakamotoWebDev
  
- Making Smart Rocks etched in hieroglyphs do Neat Tricks

- I am interested in Websites, UI/UX Design and Engineering, and Independent Web Presence.
- I believe in the Power of open source.
- I also believe in the Right to secure proprietary information.
  
    *The challenge is how We, as the Information Technology community, find a Reasonable, Ethical, and Effective balance between both.*

- I enjoy learning new concepts, and how to implement new products.
- Aspiring polyglot, open to collaboration and/or instruction on:
  
    *'.py', '.js (.jsx)', '.java', '.cpp', '.cs', '.ts', '.sql', '.go', '.swift', '.rs'*
  
- I am intrigued by the impact of Moore's Law and how it will affect Humanity. 
- The universe is discovering itself and we are the translators.
